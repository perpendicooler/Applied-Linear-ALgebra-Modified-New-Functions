1. For Problem one cholesky analysis
   
  - Just Run and modify matrices as your wish

2. Solve Tridiagonal System
   
  - It will solve the unknown of the tridiagonal
  - just input the value of the funciton and call from command window

3. Tensor

  - ttm, ttv, ttt those are for matrices vectors and tensors. 
  - Command a good example and be careful about definig tensor vector and matrices

4. For pcg
  
  - Make sure you have all the files. Generate poisson, exact solution poisson, 1138.mat file and turn them as suitesparse matrices
  - Run the test file it will call automatically other functions as well
  - Then for plotting Run the plot_results file
  - Lastly, For table just run the Tables.m files...
